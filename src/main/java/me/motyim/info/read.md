Some Info and Useful link

* to find unique element in duplicate  array we can use XOR
like problem [codeility/OddOccurresinArray/solution3]
  `x  = 3 ` , `m = 3` 
  then  `x ^ x = 0 ` 
  `x ^ m ^ x = 4 `

* use prefex sum to see number with in the range or not ex: [codeility/GenomicRangeQuery/solution3]

* order of counter sort is o(n)
